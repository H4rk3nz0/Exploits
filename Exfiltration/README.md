A simple pair of scripts designed to act as sending client and listening server. Client script sends beacon initiating file transfer and communicates the
name of the file being sent as well as encryption key and data exfiltration mode.

Once the client script reaches the last line of the exfiltrating file it will append the beacon key again informing the listener script to close the file and finish writing output to it.
The listener script will then resume listening for a new beacon connection for it's next file to write to.

Listener script also supports interrupts to sending script which catches interrupts and sends beacon to listener again closing and writing any already sent data.
